If set to false, the create page popup will instead show a link to Special:WantedPages. For example, instead of `We currently have # articles on wiki. Type your article name above or click on one of the titles below and start writing!` it would say `We currently have # articles on wiki. Type your article name above or create one of the articles listed [[Special:WantedPages|here]]!`\n\\* `$wgCosmosFetchWantedPagesFromCache` -> Caches the wanted pages. If set to true you will have to run the `updateSpecialPages.php` maintenance script to update the wanted pages list.\nNew configs unrelated to performance:\n\\* `$wgCosmosWantedPagesMaxTitlesCount` -> Allows to set the max amount of titles to show.\n\\* `$wgCosmosWantedPagesFetchedNamespaces` -> Array of namespace IDs to include pages for.\n\nIn addition, the cosmos navigation is now cached as well, so it isn't fetched on every page load. The cache is reset whenever any interface message is updated.\nOn large wikis it is recommended to set either `$wgCosmosEnableWantedPages = false;` or `$wgCosmosFetchWantedPagesFromCache = true;`, otherwise it can have significant load impact.\n\nAll config default values currently maintain the former value.

If you set one of the configs the locally uploaded file name, it will work now.\n\nAnother change done is Cosmos now preloads the wiki header background, main background, and wordmark.
